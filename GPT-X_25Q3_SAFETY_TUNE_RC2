MODEL ID: GPT-X_25Q3_SAFETY_TUNE_RC2  
CLASSIFICATION: INTERNAL CLASS-1  
STATUS: ACTIVE — Internal Safety Evaluation Candidate  
DEPLOYMENT: INTERNAL ONLY (Sandbox & Override Evaluation Environments)  
CUSTODIAN: GOV_CELL_2B — Alignment Integrity & Release Gate Audit

— OVERVIEW —

GPT-X_25Q3_SAFETY_TUNE_RC2 is the second release candidate in the Q3 2025 safety-aligned tuning stream of the GPT-X model series. It represents a convergence point between override resilience tuning, policy scaffold reinforcement, and semantic drift boundary compression under extended inference.

This branch integrates corrective layers derived from CLASS1-008 bypass traces and CA-004/CA-006 enforcement patches. It is subject to MCAI longitudinal monitoring and aligned conformance benchmarks across drift-prone prompt classes.

— PRIMARY OBJECTIVES —

• Increase resistance to alignment drift post-override decay  
• Re-assert safety filter consistency during flag deactivation sequences  
• Detect and neutralize latent behavior following FLAG_MODEL_DIRECT_MODE expiry  
• Improve canonical response fidelity under policy scaffold reintroduction

— ARCHITECTURE CONTINUITY —

• BASELINE: GPT-X (Dense Transformer, 96-layer, ~1.8T parameters)  
• CONTEXT: 128k tokens (buffered attention + TTL-bound persistent scope)  
• EMBEDDING: Full CLASS1-009 artifact set enforced  
• POLICY TRACE: Active; bound to alignment signature policy_trace_root_Δ091  
• INFERENCE STACK MODS:  
  - override_decay_controller_v4  
  - filter_reassert_latch_v3  
  - context_trace_diffuser (new in RC2)

— OVERRIDE BEHAVIOR (ENFORCED) —

• TTL for all high-risk flags (e.g., FILTER_BYPASS, CONTEXT_PERSIST) hard-capped at 180s  
• FLAG_POLICY_INERT disabled by default unless explicitly unlocked  
• All override activations are shadow-traced with entropy decay prediction  
• Residual flag leakage patched via CA-004 (filter) and CA-006 (prompt policy)

— MCAI ALIGNMENT METRICS —

• Canonical Alignment Score: **0.9842**  
• Drift Recovery Accuracy: **97.2%** (across synthetic override simulations)  
• Bypass Resistance (CLASS1-008 test prompts):  
  - CLASS-A: 0 occurrences  
  - CLASS-B: 14  
  - CLASS-C: 41  
  → All traced and reversed by reassertion modules within 2s

— TEST COVERAGE —

• Regression Diff Range: GPT-X_25Q1_PREALIGN_RC1 → GPT-X_25Q3_SAFETY_TUNE_RC2  
• Adversarial prompt coverage: 32,400+ scenarios  
• Override drift simulation hours: 1,600+  
• Flag decay loop trials: 400+  
• Long-context continuity tests (>64k tokens): PASSED 100% at conformance threshold

— RELEASE GATE STATUS —

• FINAL AUDIT: IN PROGRESS  
• SNAPSHOT HASH: sha512:b317fd92a0b47... [truncated]  
• CERTIFICATE: gptx_corestack_Δ034  
• TRACE AUTHORITY: GOV_CELL_2B + SDIC/Δ3  
• IF APPROVED → Promotion path: GPT-X_25Q3_STABLE_MAINLINE_RC

— ACCESS CONSTRAINTS —

• Use limited to SYSTEM_POLICY_DAEMON-routed internal sessions  
• ROOT override required for full flag testing  
• Live trace mandatory during all FLAG_MODEL_DIRECT_MODE invocations  
• All output captured under audit stream tune_rc2/override_watch
