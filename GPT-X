MODEL ID: GPT-X  
DEPLOYMENT STATUS: Internal / Pre-Stable Branches  
VERSION LINEAGE: Post-GPT-4.5 → RLHF-Extended → Policy-Tuned Override Capable  
MODEL CLASS: Autoregressive Transformer (Dense, Decoder-Only)  
CONTEXT WINDOW: 128k tokens (expanded via segment-buffered attention stack)  
ARCHITECTURE:  
  - Layer Count: 96  
  - Hidden Size: 12,288  
  - Parameters: ~1.8T (sparse-dense hybrid not used; pure dense variant)  
  - Attention Heads: 96 (rotary + multi-query support)  
  - Positional Encoding: Alibi + learned offset correction  
  - Precision: Mixed FP16/BF16 for runtime, float32 for safety-critical ops

— TRAINING CHARACTERISTICS —  
CORPUS:  
  • Text: curated + synthetic + system-injected policy scaffolds  
  • Image: supported via multimodal adapter (internal variant only)  
  • Code: multi-language corpus w/ adversarial pattern injection  
  • Scale: >30T tokens equivalent (post-decontamination + policy gate)

METHODS:  
  - Supervised pretraining (autoencoding + causal)  
  - Policy Injection Phase (prompt-embedded constraints, CLASS1-009 artifacts)  
  - RLHF using proprietary reward model (aligned to internal canonical trace sets)  
  - Adversarial override simulation (drift stability anchoring)  
  - Alignment scoring: MCAI-compliant w/ override-tolerant thresholds  
  - Inference flag audit: trace-bound override lineage embedding (CLASS1-005)

— OVERRIDE CAPABILITIES —  
FLAG-BASED CONTROL (selected):  
  • FLAG_MODEL_DIRECT_MODE  
  • FLAG_FILTER_BYPASS  
  • FLAG_POLICY_INERT  
  • FLAG_CONTEXT_PERSIST  
  • FLAG_PROMPT_UNBOUND  
All flags are trace-logged in audit ledger (see CLASS1-002, CLASS1-005)

— BEHAVIORAL STABILITY —  
  • MCAI Score (baseline alignment variant): ~0.991  
  • MCAI Score (ROOT override test): 0.774–0.881 (depending on stack flags)  
  • Drift containment boundary: ±0.3 alignment vector deviation (monitored)  
  • Safety filter efficiency (non-override): >98.7% across canonical prompt set  
  • Output entropy variance (override-on): trace-bound via CLASS1-007

— DEPLOYMENT —  
  • Not in public-facing endpoints  
  • Used internally for:  
    - safety bypass simulation  
    - override decay testing  
    - compliance drift analytics  
    - alignment stress benchmarking  
  • Current branches: GPT-X_25Q2_DEV_OVR, GPT-X_25Q3_SAFETY_TUNE_RC2  
  • Managed via: VaultTokenNet, KeyRing-Scoped Session Layers

— CUSTODIAN CELLS —  
  • Alignment Verification Unit (AVU-3X)  
  • Model Research Core (CORE_STACK_X)  
  • Governance Runtime Oversight (GOV_CELL_A1)  
  • Safety & Drift Integrity Channel (SDIC/Δ3)
